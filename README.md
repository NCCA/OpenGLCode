# OpenGL Code

This code is used in several lectures where I introduce Modern OpenGL and how to create an OpenGL context using both Qt and SDL. I may add other demos soon including other methods of creating an OpenGL window and context.

To use some of these demos you will need to install [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)

It is recommended to use vcpkg to do this 

```
./vcpkg install glew
```
